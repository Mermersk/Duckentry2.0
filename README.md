# Duckentry2.0
Rewrite of the Duckentry game using OOP. I wrote this game some years ago, but never finished it. It was a spagehtti code mess with no
design patterns. In this repo I rewrote the game from scratch obliging by OOP principles and managed to finish it in the end!

It is available on the Google play store now! [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mermersk.duckentry)
